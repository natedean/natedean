Consistently reading books has made an enormous positive impact on my life.
Inspired by Patrick Collison's [bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf),
here is a list of books ordered roughly by their impact on my life.

This list is intended to be regularly updated and is likely plagued by recency bias.
Sections are: non-fiction, fiction, current reading list, and started but not finished.
