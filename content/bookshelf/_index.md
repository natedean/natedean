# Why have an online bookshelf?

Consistently reading books has made an enormous positive impact on my life. Many times I struggle to remember
which books I have read, or even liked, and often wish I had a master list for myself and others to reference
for recommendations and notes.

Inspired by Patrick Collison's [bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf), here's a list of books I have read
with notes about how many times I have read them, whether or not I recommend them, and possibly other information.
The titles are below, in order, very roughly, of the impact they have made on my life, most to least.

This list is intended to be regularly updated and is likely plagued by recency bias.

\* = recommended

- **How To Win Friends And Influence People** (~10x) \*
- **Never Split The Difference Read** (3x) \*
- **The Go-Giver** \*
