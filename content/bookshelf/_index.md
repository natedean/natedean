Consistently reading books has made an enormous positive impact on my life.

Inspired by Patrick Collison's [bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf), here is a list of books I have read
ordered roughly by their impact.

This list is intended to be regularly updated and is likely plagued by recency bias.
