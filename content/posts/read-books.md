## Build Mental Models

Our mental models of the world are the frameworks of knowledge we use to understand daily situations. For example, when you are having a conversation, your mental model of what makes one a good conversationalist will drive your part.  If you have no mental model for this situation, or if your mental model is weak, you will likely make mistakes, faux pas, or unforced errors.



Some books I've read (or listened to) lately that I recommend:

* The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen R. Covey
* Never Split The Difference - Chris Voss
* The Goal - Eliyahu M. Goldratt
* Naked Economics - Charles Wheelan
* Multipliers - Liz Wiseman
* Principles - Ray Dalio
* Leaders Eat Last - Simon Sinek
* High Output Management - Andrew Grove
* The Lessons of History - Will Durant
* Crucial Conversations - Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny
* The 4-Hour Workweek - Timothy Ferriss
* The Personal MBA - Josh Kaufman
* The Power of Now - Eckhart Tolle
* Deep Work - Cal Newport
* Man's Search For Meaning - Viktor Frankl
* Devil In The White City - Erik Larson
* Wealth and Wisdom (Autobiography) - Benjamin Franklin

I plan on reading most of these again, as I find I typically have to do that to remember them more clearly.
