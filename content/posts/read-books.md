Some books I've read (or listened to) lately that I recommend, roughly sorted by their impact on my memory:

* The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen R. Covey
* Never Split The Difference - Chris Voss
* The Goal - Eliyahu M. Goldratt
* Naked Economics - Charles Wheelan
* Multipliers - Liz Wiseman
* Principles - Ray Dalio
* Leaders Eat Last - Simon Sinek
* High Output Management - Andrew Grove
* The Lessons of History - Will Durant
* Crucial Conversations - Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny
* The 4-Hour Workweek - Timothy Ferriss
* The Personal MBA - Josh Kaufman
* The Power of Now - Eckhart Tolle
* Deep Work - Cal Newport
* Man's Search For Meaning - Viktor Frankl
* Devil In The White City - Erik Larson
* Wealth and Wisdom (Autobiography) - Benjamin Franklin
* The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho

I plan on reading most of these again, as I find I typically have to do that to remember clearly. I have read these in roughly the last year.

So... why does it matter? I am NOT trying to humble brag, or prove that I am smart. Most days I feel very not smart. Many days a feel hardly better than dumb.

I am posting this list because I meticulously created the list from listening to many successful, famous, or wealthy people that recommended them. Many of these recommendations came via the wonderful [Tim Ferriss Podcast](https://tim.blog/podcast/). These books came highly recommended, they are helping me to build strong mental models of the world and its systems, and now I am recommending them to you.

## Build Mental Models

Our mental models of the world are the frameworks of knowledge we use to understand daily situations.

For example, when you are having a conversation, your mental model of what makes one a good conversationalist will drive your part. If you have no mental model for this situation, or if your mental model is weak, you will likely make mistakes, faux pas, or unforced errors.

To expand on this example, my mental model for conversations is roughly:

* Listen more than you talk, let the other person do the majority of the talking.
* To encourage your partner to speak, ask questions about things that interest them.
* Show a genuine interest as your partner is talking. Eye contact, nods, and mirroring comments.
* To avoid losing attention, listen for opportunities to summarize or "label" what a person is saying. Listening like this can prevent the mind from drifting away.
* Smile. Be real. Let that person know you care about them.

There are more, but this gives the idea. I'm sure you've met many people that do not have a good mental model of how to be a good conversationalist. They talk only of themselves, they hardly listen you, and they are mostly dreadful and boring to speak with. I've been working for a pretty long time to try to be someone that people want to talk to, and enjoy being around. It's been mostly effective, although I find that sometimes I can think to hard and become quite wooden and stiff because I'm in my own head.

So, that's a mental model for holding conversations. And there are many more I'm working on building:

* Economics and finance
* Software engineering
* Interpersonal Relationships
* Management and Leadership
* Music (Guitar, Piano, Voice)

## The Takeaway

So with that, I encourage you to go out and read books, try one from this list. Build your mental models and see how much it can help.
