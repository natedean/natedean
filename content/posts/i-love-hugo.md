## How is this website built?

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and Hugo is my new favorite thing.  Sure, this is the first thing I've built with Hugo, and I might soon begin to hit some pain points (haven't yet), or be frustrated by limitations (any limitations I've seen so far seem reasonable and would be hard to find fault with), but so far, it's nothing but love.

### Let me count some of the reasons I love Hugo

1. The "Hello World" experience is as smooth as butter. You can get from nothing (absolutely never having used the tool) to something (a website) in what seemed like less than a few minutes.
2. The themes are great.  Lots of themes to choose from, easy to install, and easy to customize.
3. It is monstrously fast to build the site and live-reloads during development feel instant.
4. Static websites are becoming more and more popular, and unlike some other popular React based frameworks, Hugo doesn't lock you into a bunch of JS to "rehydrate" the page, even if you don't need it. For a long time, the minimum Gatsby.js (another popular static site generator) JS bundle was 200k.  That's an insane amount of JavaScript for a blog, or any other low-interactivity website.
5. It feels easy to learn. The [docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) are good. There is a good [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3).  Also, installing a theme and poking around in the themes directory might be the very best way to learn, as you can see the theme's example site and compare it to the source code for insight.
6. You get so much for free. Taxonomies (grouping pages together with labels) just work.  This post is tagged as [code](https://natedean.info/tags/code).  The "Related" feature on this page is also required no additional setup. This theme, [Ananke](https://gohugo-ananke-theme-demo.netlify.com/), comes with related content and there's literally zero configuration for it to work.

### Embracing the Hugo future

I want to build more with Hugo, especially since the static files it generates are practically free to host on Amazon S3.  I am looking forward to playing with different themes, and learning more about some of the more advanced features of the framework, and practicing using them.

Sometimes you find a tool the just *feels* right.  It just fits you.  And that, is a beautiful thing.
